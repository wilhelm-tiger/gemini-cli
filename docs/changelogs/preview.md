# Preview release: v0.55.0-preview.1

Released: August 06, 2026

Our preview release includes the latest, new, and experimental features. This
release may not be as stable as our [latest weekly release](latest.md).

To install the preview release:

```
npm install -g @wilhelm-tiger/gemini-cli@preview
```

## Highlights

- **Antigravity Agent & PR Generator:** Integrated the Antigravity agent runner,
  Firestore dual-locking for concurrency, prompt templates, and ingestion
  testing utilities.
- **Caretaker Triage & Issue Management:** Enhanced the issue triage workflow by
  automatically posting a comment before closing issues, and sanitizing and
  wrapping issue titles in `untrusted_context`.
- **Core API & Session Stability:** Enforced HTTPS for
  GoogleCredentialsAuthProvider to prevent cleartext leakage, rotated session
  IDs on model fallback to prevent stateful API errors, and refined chat history
  by filtering out thought parts when context management is disabled.
